#### Project #3 for The Coding Bootcamp at UT Austin 

The goal for this project was to build an app, using React, that put contractors and remodelers together.

#### Major features include: 
  * Component-driven UI development using React.js
  * A polished front-end/UI using React-Materialize
  * Node and Express Web Server
  * MongoDB Database with a Mongoose ORM
  * GET and POST routes for retrieving and adding new data
  * Authentication of users using Redux and Passport.js
  * MVC folder structure
   
The app is designed to connect contractors with remodelers.
Other websites are not really geared for this, although they can be used for this purpose.

The site is specifically designed to give a place for the contractor to post the items that are being demoed on a site so that they don't end up in a landfill.

The contractor can post an item by category, when it needs to be picked up, and the price.
Ideally, the items would be building supplies, not furniture, but furniture that could be repurposed would end up as "misc" items.

The market would give buyers a ready marketplace, a way to recycle usable items and save money on their remodel work. 

The site would not handle money transactions. 
Instead, it would connect buyers with sellers and provide a contact method wherein the two parties can arrange the exchange to their liking (similar to Craigslist).

The site works within local ranges (similar to Craigslist) 
For development purposes, it is currently set-up to work only in Austin, TX. 
Future developments include expanding to cities nation-wide. 

In order to post items and contact sellers, users must become members by creating an account and then logging in. 
Another privilege granted to members is the ability to rate, and be rated by, other users on a 1-5 star system on whether they were a dependable buyer and/or seller. 

#### Future developments include: 
* Polished front-end/UI with React-Materialize (IN PROCESS) 
* Post/upload Item page (IN PROCESS) 
* Connecting front-end to back-end: Populating/updating database items to the site (IN PROCESS)  
* Contact seller: Chat and/or message feature (IN PROCESS)
* A "favorites" feature in which users can favorite items they like and save them to their profile
* A dashboard homepage where users can see items they've favorited, bought, and sold  
* User rating system 
* Profile verification 
* Expand to cities nation-wide
